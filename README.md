# Xash4D
This is a fork of FWGS's Xash3D fork of Xash3D. A mouthful right?
All work is theirs unless otherwise stated. (Big thanks to them for this open source gold source!)

FWGS Xash3D: [Xash3d FWGS on Github](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d)
Orignal project: [Xash3D on ModDB](http://www.moddb.com/engines/xash3d-engine)

This fork of Xash3D isn't really meant to maintain compatibility with gold source games, 
rather, it aims to upgrade the engine majorly, possibly even up to a Source engine level.
As such, the engine will not be compatible with source or even gold Source games.
While writing this, I will try to maintain the basic structure of the Source engine.
For example, I will include things like Tier0, Tier1, VPhysics, etc.

I am just a single person working on this fork, so I do NOT plan on major cross platform support
like the FWGS fork of Xash3D has. PC platforms like Windows and Linux will be supported only, no
more Android, iOS, etc. support.
